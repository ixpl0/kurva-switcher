# kurva-switcher

`kurva-switcher` is a **utility for switching keyboard layouts**, positioned as an alternative to Punto Switcher.

Currently, the application only works on Windows. You can [download](https://github.com/ixpl0/kurva-switcher/releases) it if you trust the author. Alternatively, you can build it yourself using Visual Studio or in any other way from the source code. AI can assist you in this process, just as it helped the author during development in the unfamiliar language C++.

Originally, the author developed it for personal use. This was due to a lack of trust in the few existing alternatives to Punto Switcher.

## Functionality

- **Hotkeys**  
  Switch layouts using the `Pause` or `Shift + Pause` keys (customization planned).

- **Open source**  
  Build the application from source without relying on external binaries.

- **Offline operation**  
  The application doesn't use the network.

- **Languages**  
  Toggle between English and Russian.

## Future plans

- **New languages**  
  Support for additional languages will be added in future releases.

- **macOS support**  
  Upcoming releases will include support for macOS.

- **Installer for autostart configuration**  
  An installer will be available soon. Currently, only the portable version is available.
