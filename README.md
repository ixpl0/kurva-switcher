# kurva-switcher

`kurva-switcher` is a utility for switching keyboard layouts, positioned as an alternative to Punto Switcher.

Originally developed for personal use, the author created it due to a lack of trust in the few existing Punto Switcher alternatives.

## Functionality

- **Hotkeys**  
  Switch layouts using the `Pause` or `Shift + Pause` keys (customization planned).

- **Open source**  
  Build the application from source without relying on external binaries.

- **Offline operation**  
  The application doesn't use network.

- **Languages**  
  Toggle between English and Russian.

## Plans

- **New languages**  
  Support for additional languages will be added in future releases.

- **Future macOS support**  
  Upcoming releases will include support for macOS, broadening the range of compatible devices.

- **Installer for autostart configuration**  
  A dedicated installer for convenient autostart setup will be available soon.
